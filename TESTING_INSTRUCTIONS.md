### 5. Verify Model Data
Check that `model_data.json` contains all models:
- Open `model_data.json` in a text editor
- Verify that all 19 models are present in the `model_mapping` section
- Ensure all models are listed in the `supported_models` array

### 6. Common Issues and Solutions
If any models are not working:

1. **Check browser console** for specific error messages
2. **Verify model names match exactly** between:
   - HTML select options
   - model_data.json mappings
   - bikeInfo JavaScript object
3. **Clear browser cache** and reload the page
4. **Check that the server is running** (`node server.js`)

### 7. Expected Results
When testing each model, you should see:
- Predicted price calculation
- Model-specific pros and cons
- Age and kms driven insights
- Smooth scrolling to results

All 19 Royal Enfield models should work identically with only the predicted price and model information varying based on the specific model characteristics.
